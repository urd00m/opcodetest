- Microcode instruction from twitter source should be 0x0f 0 {x} (2 byte instruction) 
	- Need to be in red unlocked mode to access this, which should only be avaible to intel, however, if there are management engine vulnerabilities then we could get into (possible) 
- Set up github and documentation 
- Seeing what happens if you run an invalid opcode does it through a UD 
- Ran the instruction 0x0f (not an instruction) recieved an illegal instruction error 
	- Is that a #UD?
	- 0x0f0a causes an illegal instruction 
	- 0x0f0b is a ud2 (illegal instruction)
